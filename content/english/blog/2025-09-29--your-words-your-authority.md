# Draft agenda

* 1 - Intro
  * mention dr grace lee, her video, what it is about, give attribution, link, embed, embelish
  * introducec golden thread, Frame the entire discussion around the idea that "Your Language is Your Leadership Operating System." This theme suggests that the phrases we use are not just words, but the underlying code that runs our leadership style, determines our team's culture, and either enables or limits our impact.
* 2 - agenda
  * mention the 7 phrases, and how we will group them
  * mention how we will treat (speak about colleagues and reports, and then we will talk about alternatives)
* 3 - the loop
  * phrases of self doubt (undermining your conviction)
    * i think i could
    * im not sure if this is, but
    * does that make sense?
  * phrases of deference (diminishing your status)
    * sorry just one quick point
    * we cant
  * the internal monologue (shaping your actions)
    * thats above my pay grade
    * ill just do it myself
* conclusion
  * thank dr grace lee
  * give important to paying attention to our language, our operating system
  * explain how different people perceive things differently
  * how we speak is how we think
  * call to action, be purposeful and with intent in everything you say+

Recently, Dr. Grace Lee has published a new video about what kind of phrases or language leaders should avoid when addressing board members or presenting at the boardroom. How we present ourselves as leaders has always fascinated me, as there is so much nuance and choices that need to be made that usually escape our coloquial, informal everyday attitude. This recent video actually inspired me to want to talk more about the topic.

I definitely recommend watching it if you are into this stuff as I am. Dr. Grace Lee is a seasoned professional whose youtube channel is always focused on executive level conversations with strategic focus. She is insightful as articulate, providing often actionable guidance together with perceptive analysis. I am embedding the video below, definitely give it a watch and subscribe, you won't regret it.

However, from this particular video there was something that was missing. Here Dr. Grace Lee goes over a myriad of phrases and ways of thinking that would turn the delivery of your ideas and proposals into weak and potentially harmful speech. For anyone that wants to succeed and continue growing as a leader, it is imperative we look at our we serve others not only through our actions but through our attitudes. And language is a big part of how our attitude is perceived, and it also shapes how we ourselves operate.

Her video discusses all of this, but only when considering the boardroom, usually people that we must report to. But today we will be expanding this in two ways.
* How these phrases work (against you) when speaking with colleagues and reports.
* What can we do as an alternative

Watch the video below for a more thorough context, or continue with the next section.

## The golden thread

Your words are your leadership blueprint. What you say is as important as what you do. Your language must have intentional design upon which your team's culture, trust and even psychological safety are built on. Want to build resilient teams? We must start with how we speak.

More often than not, if we are not purposeful and aware of how we construct our words (and our ideas) we are letting others down. It is not uncommon for reports to become disappointed or even completely lose faith about a certain situation merely because of the way we presented it.

We will be expanding on top of Dr. Grace Lee's work and see how this impacts our surroundings, and diminishes our own leverage as leaders. We can measure how good our leadership is by how much we multiply through others. If we do the opposite of inspiring others, then we are reducing our own leverage.

## The three themes

While not originally grouped this way by Dr. Grace Lee, we can identify three different patterns in the phrases showing.

* Phrases that introduce self-doubt
  * These are phrases that undermine our conviction and makes us look undecisive. Thinsk like "I think I could", "I am not sure if this helps but" and "Does that make sense?" immediately hinders our impact when we speak.
* Phrases of deference
  * These are the ones that diminish our status and can even transmit we are wasting people's time. "Sorry, just one quick point" and "We can't" fall into this category.
* Phrases of internal monologue
  * These shape our actions, and potentially hurt us a great deal without us even knowing. "That's above my pay grade" and "I'll just do it myself" can be quite destructive for leaders looking to increment their leverage game.

Now, let's move into this meaty topic. For each phrase let's do the following:
* Explain it briefly, as shown in the video
* See how this affects colleagues
* See how this affects reports
* Explore alternative ways of expressing the same ideas, but without the negative effect.

## Phrases of self-doubt

### "I think... could..."

* "I think I could achieve this"
* "I think we could do better next time"
* "I think we could meet the deadline if"

All of these noncommittal phrases express self doubt, express guess work, express lack of capability.

If you are using this with your colleagues, as in, people around the same rank, perhaps other departments, etc. You are probably thinking "Let me propose an alternative, without me dismissing what you have proposed". This has good will and you are probably trying to be polite. "I think we could do better next time if instead of measuring page views we instead measure how users are executing the report and look at the number of times they export it, or perhaps how long they stay active on the page before moving on". Or perhaps you want to emphasise how your team can achieve something. "I think we could achieve this if we are able to define the scope within the next week". There is a small variation of this I see often, which trades self doubt for doubt in others, which can also be taken the wrong way. "Have we tried to measure the performance of the report X way?". Again, you are coming from the same place. You are trying to not come out as if you know all the answers, or as if you are possibly dismissing other people's work, or come off as an authoritative person.

Personally, it is always possible that within colleagues you will usually have more of a round table, where everyone gets to express their ideas. Sure, some tables are more political than others, but we should always aim to speak without filter in these types of groups. However, maybe we can be more assertive and ensure we are not expressing doubt.

When we are speaking to colleagues, we could trade "I think I could" or "Have we...?" for direct, assertive yet open language. We actually had a similar version at the very beginning:
* I propose we ...
* The way I see it, we can ...

And, depending on the forum, if we want to ensure we are not being closed minded, we can finalise our proposals or phrases as "That is the way I see it. Does anyone see anything else?" or "While I firmly believe in the idea, I am wondering what you think."
