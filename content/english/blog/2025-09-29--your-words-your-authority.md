Have you ever felt that you had something important to say, but the way you said it destroyed your own self confidence and, what's worse, you were unable to drive the point home? Recently, Dr. Grace Lee has published a new video about what kind of phrases or language leaders should avoid when addressing board members or in high stakes conversations. The art of leadership presentation has always fascinated me, as there is so much nuance in the choices that need to be made that usually escape our informal everyday attitude. This recent video actually inspired me to do a deeper dive into the topic. Specifically, I want to explore not just what not to say, but how these phrases impact our own teams and, most importantly, what powerful alternatives we can use instead.

I highly recommend watching the full video. For any leader fascinated by the nuances of high-stakes communication, Dr. Lee's work is a valuable resource. Dr. Grace Lee is a seasoned professional whose youtube channel is always focused on executive level conversations with strategic focus. She is both insightful and articulate, consistently providing actionable guidance grounded in perceptive analysis. I am embedding the video below, and I encourage you to explore her channel for more content on executive communication.

Dr. Leeâ€™s advice is an excellent foundation for high-stakes communication. However, her focus is primarily on the boardroom. To truly master our leadership, we must also explore how we serve others not only through our actions but through our attitudes. Language is the primary tool through which our attitude is perceived and our own thinking is shaped. This is where we must introduce a core idea: Your Language is Your Leadership Blueprint. The words you choose don't just convey ideas; they are the architectural plans that your team uses to build your culture. Every phrase lays a foundation for either trust or doubt, clarity or confusion.

This blueprint is built on a powerful feedback loop: how we think shapes how we speak, but just as importantly, the language we consciously choose reshapes how we think. Changing our words isn't an act of pretense; it is the work of rewiring our own leadership mindset. With that in mind, let's explore the common phrases that can undermine our foundation.

Dr. Lee's video focuses on how these phrases are perceived in high-stakes conversations with senior leaders. This article will expand on her work in two key ways:

- First, we will analyze how these same phrases work against you when speaking with your peers and direct reports.
- Second, for each phrase, we will provide powerful, actionable alternatives you can use instead.

## The golden thread

Your words are your leadership blueprint. What you say is as important as what you do. Your language must have intentional design upon which your team's culture, trust and even psychological safety are built on. Want to build resilient teams? We must start with how we speak to them.

More often than not, if we are not purposeful and aware of how we construct our words (and our ideas) we are letting others down. It is not uncommon for reports to become disappointed or even completely lose faith about a certain situation or new direction merely because of the way we presented it.

We will be expanding on top of Dr. Grace Lee's work and see how this impacts our surroundings, and diminishes our own leverage as leaders. We can measure how good our leadership is by how much we multiply through others. If we do the opposite of inspiring others, then we are losing our own leverage and we will be losing our team.

## The three themes

While not originally grouped this way by Dr. Grace Lee, we can identify three different patterns:

- Phrases that introduce **self-doubt**
  - These are phrases that undermine our conviction and makes us look undecisive. Thinsk like "I think I could", "I am not sure if this helps but" and "Does that make sense?" immediately hinders our impact when we speak.
- Phrases of **deference**
  - These are the ones that diminish our status and can even transmit we are wasting people's time. "Sorry, just one quick point" and "We can't" fall into this category.
- Phrases of **risky internal monologue**
  - These shape our actions, and potentially hurt us a great deal without us even knowing. "That's above my pay grade" and "I'll just do it myself" can be quite destructive for leaders looking to increment their leverage game.

## Phrases of self-doubt

- I think ... I could ...
- I am not sure this helps but ...
- Does that make sense?

All of these noncommittal phrases express self doubt, express guess work, express lack of capability. But let's also be clear, these are valid in the right context. It's just that we must be strategic when we use them.

If you are using this with your colleagues, as in, people around the same rank, perhaps other departments, etc. You are probably thinking "Let me propose an alternative, without me dismissing what you have proposed". This has good will and you are probably trying to be polite. "I think we could do better next time if instead of measuring page views we instead measure how users are executing the report and look at the number of times they export it, or perhaps how long they stay active on the page before moving on". Alternatively, perhaps you want to emphasise how your team can achieve something. "I think we could achieve this if we are able to define the scope within the next week".

Personally, it is always possible that within colleagues you will usually have more of a friendly round table, where everyone gets to express their ideas. Everytime I setup one of these sessions or groups, I start by telling everyone that _"here we accept criticism and we should be open to disagreement, here is where we need to be honest"_. So under those very clear rules it is possible you can let your guard down a bit and just use the quoted phrases. Sure, some tables are more political than others, but we should always aim to speak without filter in these types of groups. That still does not mean that using a more assertive and leader-worthy language is not going to improve the outcome of our conversations.

When we are speaking to colleagues, we could trade "I think I could" or "Have we...?" for direct, assertive yet open language. We actually had a similar version at the very beginning:

- I propose we ...
- Based on everything said, we can ...
- It would seem we have no impediment to ...

These are fine, and provide a more direct language while still expressing confidence in what you are saying. However, we must ensure we are keeping an open conversation and that others participate, give us their feedback and their honest opinion. To be honest, I too use "Does that make sense?" quite often, but especially as a sort of finishing phrase when we have all agreed to something already, not in this situation where I want to continue the chat. We could, instead, use some form of the following:

- While I firmly believe in the idea, I am wondering what you think.
- That is the way I see it so far, but I would very much appreciate your own thoughts on this.

And I would definitely scratch a phrase like "I am not sure this helps but" or anything similar. People look at you, as a leader, for some security and confidence. If you have an idea you are not sure it would work, then what I often do is just "think out loud". For example, someone brings me an issue of resource capacity and I have no clue about the solution yet, but I might have _something_ then I would say _"I am just thinking out loud, but possibly if we are able to finish the next iteration of project A, then John and Joseph can jump and review the technical approach of project B next Monday. We'd need to discuss with their manager of course, but this is something we can potentially do without impacting anyone's timeline"_. In this case, I am not really sure about it, but I would be ready to commit to _trying_. You will see from the video that "I will try" is noncommital as well, a language that seems to lessen or eliminate the accountability of our own words and ideas. Here, we are having a conversation, but eventually before we finish that conversation, I would summarise things in an assertive manner and ensure we have owners for everything. Something like _"Then, as we discussed, I will line up resources from project B to help project A on Monday. You will support the team on these conversations and onboard John and Joseph on this topic before that conversation."_ and I might end saying something like _"Makes sense?"_. Personally, it's not a sin to use that phrase _in this context_.

# Phrases of deference

- "Sorry, just one quick point"
- "We can't"

The first one is very similar to "I am not sure if this helps but" but there is a slight difference. Here, we are saying sorry and potentially adding something that is too small and inconsequential. So why are we even adding a comment and wasting people's time? Where the other one is more about self doubt.

These two phrases are very distinct to each other. The first one, the one that says "Sorry" is introducing the idea that your idea is not worth the time. The second phrase removes you from the kind of people that can get things done. Psychologically, you are not only saying that you cannot do something right now, but you are signaling to everyone that you do not have the capability of seeing a solution here. Now, there might be some scenarios where this is the right call. _"We cannot break the trust of our customers"_ or _"We cannot do that, it would be a breach of contract"_. We do sometimes have to speak clearly and state when something cannot be done. I would still argue that perhaps what is the goal of said conversations is not to break the trust of customers or breach a contract, but to achieve something and you are simply discarding a proposed solution. You could, still, instead ask differently. _"I need a bit more help on this. Could you explain to me how you see this idea being implemented without breaching our contract? Perhaps I misunderstood you"_. This would be a more Simon Sinek-esque way of approaching said conversation.

Now, if you were discussing ideas with colleagues or your team, and the natural response is _"cant"_ then I propose you turn this into a trigger. If you are about to say something cannot be done, stop you there for a second. Think about it and ask if you are leveraging your colleagues or team well enough. Is it really that it cannot be done? Or that you do not know if it can be done? Turn this into an opportunity to make an insightful question to the rest of the group _"We all know this seems to be extremely challenging, so we should welcome ideas from anyone. Would someone like to share any thoughts? They dont need to be complete, but perhaps we use it to get us started in the conversation"_. Now, let's say that you have already said "cant" but realised you said it later. You can always correct yourself quickly. _"Let me rephrase this, it would seem right now that we cant do this. However, I think we can further explore a solution here."_ and then follow up with an action, whether it is asking for options, feedback, or directing everyone to a specific part of the problem. People will not think less of you for correcting yourself immediately. They might even see you as a very self aware leader.

On the topic of "Sorry, one more thing", then you can be a bit more expressive. If its only point you wish to make, you could use _"Before we go"_ or _"Before we move to the next topic"_ and then spell it out _"It is important that X"_ or _"We must also ensure that"_. It will really depend on what you wish to say and then use a positive structure that does not start by undermining what you are going to say, or undermine yourself. Let's say we are wrapping up around the budget for next year, I might end saying something like _"Before we move on top another topic, I would like to also establish clearly that, while the budget is covering our current plans, we could still be tight for capacity as there is little buffer. Be it that we get pressure from a customer or we find an issue that is GP sensititive, we could run out of options soon. I propose we review our budget every 3 months. Would you mind if we agree on this idea now and we establish an owner for said review?"_. Maybe the idea does not fly at all, but you have presenting it in an insightful way without pointing fingers, but establishing that what you said is important and we should act on it. If we had started with "Sorry, one more point" it might have been easily dismissed like _"We can discuss that later"_. You dismissed yourself.

Finally, if you wanted to make several points, you could then completely dismiss the "Sorry" part and do a small introduction to what you are going to say: _"Before we move on, I have two points to make. First, potential risks that could impact these timelines, and second, I think we should take the opportunity to review the budget in 3 months time. On the first topic..."_. In this case, we are mixing a few tactics. One is establishing a quick agenda, you will be talking about two points, so you have asked everyone to listen to you during those two points, you have reclaimed the space temporarily so they let you talk. It would be easy for someone to interrupt you during or at the end of the first point so they could reply to you. This would set you back on your own narration.

# Phrases of risky internal monologue

- That's above my pay grade / That's not my job
- I'll just do it myself

As Dr. Lee mentions, these are usually said internally, although sometimes we can hear them externally as well. Be it because of social media, TV series or movies, we could tend to think that saying something is above our pay grade is somehow a type of "power move" where we are establishing clear boundaries to someone, or we are subtly complaining about the state of things and how things are done. What you will be doing in this case is undermining yourself as _"I am neither interested nor ready to take on this"_. One thing we should be very clear about is that there is a part of the job where we are accountable by default; its just our job description, and the team we lead and their deliverable or objectives. However, once you started leading people, you have joined a new board and the question is what you will do next. When we move into leadership positions, we will be thrown opportunity after opportunity of increasing our accountability. It is often, though, that a lot of professionals take on more responsibilities but are unable to follow that with career growth. That is a separate topic, but I can already give you a spoiler: "You have the leverage".

When you say something is not your job, then there are at least two proposals I can make you. First, if you truly believe this is out of bounds for you then the question is _"Do you know who should be doing this?"_. Instead of rejecting the idea, you could redirect your energy and say something like _"I believe we should have UX involved in this, they need to own this decision, not me. I am happy to follow up with them if that's fine with you."_. Take ownership, but also honour people's jobs and opportunities. Become the facilitator, not a contract oriented silo. If you do not enjoy your job or have a particularly bad experience with your managers, I would still propose you do this. No one can take away the experience you build doing this, and you can bring that into your next leadership role if your days at your current company are counted.

Another thing that happens often is that we become bitter because we are actually doing something out of bounds, but we expect someone else to be taking charge. In these cases maybe its worth clarifying with your own manager where your time needs to be spent, and instead of dismissing accountability or responsibility for the thing you are doing, present it as _"I have the impression my time would be best spent in X activities. Can you help me delegate this over to Y team?"_. This is a positive framing, you are not coming with an ultimatum, and you are not showing lack of ownership. Quite the contrary, you are now working outside of your own cone of authority, and now working on how you influence the rest of the org. This is the actual power move.

On the last one, if you are thinking _I can do this quickly_ then 99% of the time I would tell you you are losing an opportunity to delegate. Sure, you might be the uttermost expert in the topic and perhaps can get something done blindfolded, but you are missing out on investing your time in others. Instead of working in **production**, work in **reproduction** as said by Ken Coleman. But I will admit sometimes it is also worth leading by example in the trenches themselves. You just have to be very cautious on what you choose to take on your own. If you take a task that can be done better by your team, then keep it delegated. You might be thinking that this is a way for you to learn as well, but this might send the wrong signals to your team. Again, it might not, it might actually generate a deeper connection. You will need to know your team very well before taking on something they can do better. They could feel you are the one diminishing them. If you are taking something that surpasses the team's capabilities, then your job should be to invest and grow your people so they can surpass the task. If the challenge is just a bit outside of their boundary of expertise, then it's a fantastic growth opportunity as it is right now. Give it to them and they will grow that extra bit they need. And if you are the expert here, even better, coach them through, but empower them to resolve it. In rare instances, you investing in explaining this to the team could signify a complete disaster if one of your variables just gets out of control (like time, or scope). There is that 1% of times where its better you do it, but as we have seen, most of the time its better you investt in the people. It is always the best move here.

# Conclusion

Dr. Lee is a fantastic coach for executives, and although sometimes uses very complicated terms in her videos, what she speaks about is very valuable and insightful, and remains relevant in the executive world of today. I think its not only for senior leaders to listen to her, but also anyone in the growing stages of leadership (which we always are). While I felt her video could use more of what we did today, it was inspiring for me and made me realise how much I love the topic of how we use our language. Because its not about the words, its about the impact we make in others. Inspiring others might be the hardest yet most important thing we do as leaders, so every bit of knowlege and wisdom we can grasp on this topic might make us multiple times better. Its not about cheap politics and saving face, its about sending the right signals to do better business and be better humans.
